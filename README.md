# Wordle
Wordle Solver

This program takes a wordlist titled FiveLetters.txt and trims it with each clue you give it from Wordle.
Make your first guess on Wordle.  Run the program and provide each letter, color (Green, Yellow, Black), and position when necessary.
The updated word list will be printed after each clue is entered.
Use the new, shorter word list to identify your next guess.
Simply press enter a couple times to close the program.
